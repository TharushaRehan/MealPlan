This is an Android App that I developed for one of my coursework. The app is about displaying different meal plans based on the input. Users can search for meals by the meal name and ingredients. Also, users can save meals in the database (SQLite). The app uses TheMealDB web service.

Functionalities
1. Displaying meal plans with instructions, ingredients and measurements.
2. Search Meals by the meal name and ingredients from the web service.
3. Save meal details in a local database (SQLite).
4. Search Meals by the meal name and ingredients from the database.
